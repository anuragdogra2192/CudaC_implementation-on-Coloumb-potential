### CudaC_implementation-on-Coulomb's-potential

This small project is about implementation of cuda c on the Coulomb Potential C code.For refering the Theory of Coulomb's Law  refer this link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb%27s_law

This is a very good example to implement Cuda C in any scientfic problem, or its a good start for beginners to apply CUDA C in the field of Moleculer Dynamics.
