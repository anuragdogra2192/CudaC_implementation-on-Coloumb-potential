# CudaC_implementation-on-Coloumb-potential

This project is about implementation of cuda c on the Coloumb Potential C code.For refering the Theory of Coloumb potential 
problem refer this link https://github.com/anuragdogra2192/MPI-on-Coulombs-Potential-solver-Molecular-Dynamics 

This is a very good example to implement Cuda C in any scientfic problem, or its a good start for beginner to apply CUDA C in the field of Moleculer Dynamics.
